\noindent Many of the systems studied here are taken from textcite:koistinenMinimumModeSaddle2020 and the data has been kindly provided by Villi. Before describing the data-sets used, as well as the results; we will give a brief overview of the coupling of ~eon~ to the ~GPR Dimer~ library. The results of textcite:koistinenAlgorithmsFindingSaddle2019 established a baseline for studying the effects of accelerating saddle search methods namely:
- Nudged elastic band calculation cite:koistinenNudgedElasticBand2017,koistinenNudgedElasticBand2019
- Tailored bespoke covariance functions for atomic data cite:koistinenNudgedElasticBand2019,koistinenMinimumModeSaddle2020
- Proof of concept studies of accelerating surface walking methods like the dimer cite:asgeirssonExploringPotentialEnergy2018 using Gaussian Process Regression cite:koistinenMinimumModeSaddle2020
However, these proof of concept studies were implemented in MATLAB and were not amenable to large systems due to both theoretical restrictions and computational inefficiency.
*  Architecture
** Programming Methodology
The GPR dimer is implemented as a stand-alone library with minimally invasive changes to the EON code. This allowed for the use of modern and performance oriented programming practices like:
- Extensive Testing
  - Both unit tests and integration tests are provided
  - ~eon~ does not include a unit testing framework
    - An extensive set of manual test cases are provided to replicate all existing literature results
*** Third Party Libraries and Licenses
*** Structure
** Machine Learning Concepts
** EON Concepts
We will establish some terminology to begin with.
- Free Atoms :: These atoms are moved by the client
- Fixed Atoms :: These are the atoms which are indicated in ~con~ files generated by the ~eon~ server to not be moved by the ~eonclient~ binary
- Frozen Atoms :: These are defined in the GPR to be those atoms which do not move; so they are equivalent to ~eon~'s fixed specification
  - Active Frozen :: A GPR only restriction, due to the poor scaling of the high dimensional observations
* Toy Systems
These include standard benchmarks for the minimum mode saddle search problems in general.
** Platinum
Chronologically the first system tested here. The system has some pleasant qualities which make it easy to work and test:
- Easy control of the degrees of freedom
  - Achieved by varying the number of moving atoms and the fixed atoms
- Homogeneity meant neither atomic numbers nor atomic masses were required
- Cheap throwaway potential (Morse)

In particular, we present results on several systems of varying size.
*** One Platinum AdaAtom on a Pt Surface
* Literature Reproductions
** Oxadiazole from N2O and Ethylene
Described in cite:koistinenMinimumModeSaddle2020.
** Allyl Vinly Ether Rearrangement
Also in cite:koistinenMinimumModeSaddle2020.

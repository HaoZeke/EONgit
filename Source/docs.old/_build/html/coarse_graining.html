<p>In AKMC simulations where there are vastly different rates, the simulation can
get stuck in a group of states connected by relatively fast rates. In order to
explore slower transitions, a prohibitively large number of KMC steps may be
needed. In order to circumvent this problem, eOn implements two methods. The
first method, projective dynamics <a class="footnote-reference" href="#novotny" id="id2">[1]</a>, groups states that are joined by
fast rates into &#8220;superbasins&#8221;. Information about transitions between states in
a superbasin is lost, but the rates for transitions across a superbasin are
correct. The second method, accelerated superbasining kinetic Monte Carlo
(AS-KMC) <a class="footnote-reference" href="#voter" id="id3">[2]</a>, artificially raises low barriers. The dynamics between
states connected by fast rates are simulated, but an error is introduced in the
dynamics direction and time. Both methods cannot be used simultaneously.</p>
<p>Options for these methods go in the <strong>[Coarse Graining]</strong> section.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Default: transition_counting</p>
<p>Projective dynamics provides a method for calculating transition rates
across superbasins. An additional method is needed in order to decide when
to combine states into a superbasin. eOn provides two methods. The first
method, called &#8220;transition counting&#8221;, counts the number of times that the
simulation has transitioned between a given pair of states. After a
critical number of transitions have occured, the pair of states are merged
to form a superbasin. (If one is already in a superbasin, the other is
added to that superbasin. If both are already in superbasins, the two
superbasins are merged). This method can be selected by setting scheme
equal to &#8216;transition_counting&#8217;. <strong>Jean-Claude: document your scheme here</strong>
This method can be elected by setting scheme equal to &#8216;energy_level&#8217;.</p>

<h2>Accelerated Superbasin Kinetic Monte Carlo<a class="headerlink" href="#accelerated-superbasin-kinetic-monte-carlo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic process of AS-KMC involves gradually raising process barriers
found to be inside of a superbasin such that exiting from the basin
gradually becomes more likely. The method is designed to raise all the
barriers in the superbasin simultaneously. Once a particular barrier has
been crossed a certain number of times, <span class="math">\(N_f\)</span> (more on determining
<span class="math">\(N_f\)</span> shortly), a check is performed to determine whether or not the
current state is part of a superbasin. This is called the Superbasin
Criterion. In the Superbasin Criterion, a search is performed, originating
at the current state and proceeding outward through all low-barrier
processes to adjacent states, and then through all low-barrier processes
from each of these states, etc. For each low-barrier process found, if the
process has been followed fewer than <span class="math">\(N_f\)</span> times, the Superbasin
Criterion fails and no barriers are raised. Thus, in the outward-expanding
search from the originating state, the search continues until either a
low-barrier process has been seen fewer than <span class="math">\(N_f\)</span> times (and the
Criterion fails) or until all connected low-barrier processes have been
found and have been crossed at least <span class="math">\(N_f\)</span> times (the edges of the
superbasin are then defined and the Criterion passes). If the Superbasin
Criterion passes, all the low-barrier processes (each of which as been
crossed <span class="math">\(N_f\)</span> times) are raised.</p>
<p>Several parameters dictate the functioning of the AS-KMC method. These
parameters dictate how much the barriers are raised each time the
Superbasin Criterion passes(<strong>askmc_barrier_raise_param</strong>), what defines a
“low-barrier” for use in the Superbasin
Criterion(<strong>askmc_high_barrier_def</strong>), and the approximate amount of error
the user might expect in eventual superbasin exit direction and time
compared to normal kmc simulation (<strong>askmc_confidence</strong>).</p>

<p>Default: True</p>
<p>Because the implemented Superbasin Criterion actually only considers
processes which have been passed over at least once, there is some chance
that a low-barrier process in a superbasin might have not been visited at
all while all other low-barrier processes have been visited at least
<span class="math">\(N_f\)</span> times. This is unlikely, but this test verifies that such has
not happened, considering even processes which have not been visited when
determining if the Superbasin Criterion has first, because the implemented
Superbasin Criterion actually only considers processes which have been
passed over at least once, there is some chance that a low-barrier process
in a superbasin might have not been visited at all while all other
low-barrier processes have been visited at least <span class="math">\(N_f\)</span> times. This is
unlikely, but this test verifies that such has not happened, considering
even processes which have not been visited when determining if the
Superbasin Criterion has passed. This check should not add significant
overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>askmc_connections_test_on</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Default: False</p>
<p>This parameter determines whether to ensure that there are no processes
which connect states in the defined superbasin which have not been visited
yet and which have a low-barrier. This check is somewhat more
computationally expensive than the previous because structure comparisons
have to be made when finding product states of unvisited processes.</p>

The following contains general options which specify the calculation to be done
and general parameters which are shared between job types.

Job
---

Option is in the [Main] section.

**job**

    Default: *none*

    Options:

        *process_search*: Combined saddle search, minimizations, and prefactor calculations.  Used by the aKMC method.

        *saddle_search*: Do a saddle point search using a minimum mode method.

        *minimizaion*: Find the minimum from an initial configuration.

        *hessian*: Calculate the Hessian matrix for the specified configuration in a process.

        *parallel_replica*: Calculate the rare-event dynamics of the system by combining transitions observed from multiple trajectories run in parallel.

        *dimer_dr*: Rye is changing this.

        *dimer_rotation*: Rye is changing this.

        *displacement_sampling*:  Job to sample different displacement methods and parameters to see which are the most efficient.

        *tip4p*: Point charge model for water.

        *bopfox*: Bond order potential, for metals.

        *bop*: Bond order potential, for metals.


General simulation parameters
-----------------------------

Options in the [Main] section.

**random_seed** [-1]
    When set to a positive value, a serial simulation can be repeated (usually for debugging purposes).

**calculate_prefactor** [true]
    Calculate prefactor if true, otherwise assume a standard value of xxx.

**minimize_only** [false]
    Only minimize the structure.  *Should be moved?*

**minimize_box** [false]
    Minimize the box dimentions.

**max_difference_pos** [0.1]
    Maximum distance for which two configurations are considered the same. *Should be combined with server-side variable and moved to [Sructure Comparison]*

**save_stdout** [false]
    Save the standard output from the client and report it back to the server. *Should move to debug?*

**converged_relax** [0.005]
    Force below which a configuration is considered minimzed. *Should be combined with server-side variable and moved to [Sructure Comparison]*

EON
================================

The EON program contains a set of algorithms used primarily to model the 
evolution of atomic scale systems over long time scales.  Standard molecular
dynamics algorithms, based upon solving Newton's equations, are limited by
the femtosecond time scale of atomic vibrations.  EON simulations are designed
for rare event systems where the interesting dynamics can be described by fast
transition between stable states.  In each algorithm, the residence time in
the stable states is modeled with statisical mechanics, and the important
state-to-state dynamics are modeled stochastically.

The following contains general options which are common to the algorithms.

=============================
General Simulation Parameters
=============================

The following contains general options which specify the calculation to be done
and general parameters which are shared between job types.

Main
----

These are options that go in the [Main] section of ``config.ini``.

``job``

    Default: ``None``

    Options:

        ``akmc``: Run an adaptive kinetic monte carlo simulation.
         
        ``parallel_replica``: Calculate the rare-event dynamics of the system by combining transitions observed from multiple trajectories run in parallel.

        ``process_search``: Combined saddle search, minimizations, and prefactor calculations.  Used by the aKMC method.

        ``saddle_search``: Do a saddle point search using a minimum mode method.

        ``minimizaion``: Find the minimum from an initial configuration.

        ``hessian``: Calculate the Hessian matrix for the specified configuration in a process.

        ``dimer_dr``: Rye is changing this.

        ``dimer_rotation``: Rye is changing this.

        ``displacement_sampling``:  Job to sample different displacement methods and parameters to see which are the most efficient.


``potential``

    Default: ``None``

    Options:

        ``lj_rh``: Lennard-Jones poential for rhodium.

        ``morse_pt``: Morse potential for platinum.

        ``emt``: Effective medium theory, for metals.

        ``edip``: Environment-Dependent Interatomic Potential, for carbon.

        ``vasp``: Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Program (VASP) interface.

        ``tersoff_si``: Tersoff pair potential with angular terms, for silicon.

        ``sw_si``: Stillinger-Weber potential, for silicon.

        ``lenosky_si``: Lenosky potential, for silicon.

        ``eam_al``: Embedded atom method parameterized for aluminum.

        ``qsc``: Quantum Sutton Chen potential, for metals.

        ``zpice``: Water on platinum.

        ``tip4p``: Point charge model for water.

        ``bopfox``: Bond order potential, for metals.

        ``bop``: Bond order potential, for metals.


``temperature`` 

    Default: 300

    The temperature of the simulation, in Kelvin.

``random_seed``

    Default: None

    When set to a previously used seed a simulation can be repeated.

Structure Comparison
--------------------------------

``energy_difference`` 

    Default: 0.01

    How close in energy two configurations must be to be considered 
    energetically equivalent.
    
``distance_difference``
    
    Default: 0.05

    The maximum distance two mapped atoms may be for two configurations to be 
    considered equivalent.
    
``use_identical`` 

    Default: True

    Use an algorithm to compare structures that does not distinguish between
    atoms of the same element. That is to say the numbering of the atoms does
    not affect the structural comparison.

``neighbor_cutoff``

    Default: 3.3

    Atoms within this distance of each other are considered neighbors.

``use_covalent``

    Default: False

    Use the covalent radii of atoms to determine neighbors.

``covalent_scale``

    Default: 1.3

    Multiply covalent radii by this amount before determining neighbors.

``brute_neighbors``

    Default: False

    Determine neighbors by brute force (use this with nonorthogonal boxes).

Paths
-----

Location of files related to the sending and receiving data on the server.

``main_directory`` 

    Default: ./

    This is the root directory of the simulation. Configuration files and the
    initial reactant are here and by default all of the simulation data will be
    stored under this directory.

``searches_in``

    Default: ``main_directory``/searches/in/

    ???

``states``

    Default: ``main_directory``/states/

    Where all of the information about individual states is located.

``scratch`` [main_directory/searches/scratch/]

    ???

``potential_files``

    Default: ``main_directory``/potfiles

    For extra files needed by the client for the potential.


General simulation parameters from client?
------------------------------------------

Options in the [Main] section.

``calculate_prefactor`` [true]
    Calculate prefactor if true, otherwise assume a standard value of xxx.

``minimize_only`` [false]
    Only minimize the structure.  ``Should be moved?``

``minimize_box`` [false]
    Minimize the box dimentions.

``max_difference_pos`` [0.1]
    Maximum distance for which two configurations are considered the same. ``Should be combined with server-side variable and moved to [Sructure Comparison]``

``save_stdout`` [false]
    Save the standard output from the client and report it back to the server. ``Should move to debug?``

``converged_relax`` [0.005]
    Force below which a configuration is considered minimzed. ``Should be combined with server-side variable and moved to [Sructure Comparison]``

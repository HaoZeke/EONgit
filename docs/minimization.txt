==============
Minimization
==============
The eOn client provides two methods for local minimization of structures, quick-min and conjugate gradients.

These options are in the [Default] section. 

**maximum_iterations** [512]
    The maximum number of force calls that the minimizer will perform.

**converged_relax** [0.005]
    When the maximum force (in eV/angstrom) on any one atom is smaller than this value, the structure is considered minimized.

Quick-min
----------
These options are in the [QM] section.

**time_step** [0.1] 
    The dynamical timestep for the quickmin algorithm.

Conjugate Gradients
-------------------
These options are in the [CG] section.

**curvature_step** [0.001]
    Finite difference step used to determine curvature.

**max_move** [0.2]
    Maximum distance that the structure may be moved in a single minimization step.

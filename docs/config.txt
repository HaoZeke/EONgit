EON configuration
================================

The eOn program uses a single configuration file, config.ini. 
The *.ini* format consists of sections, keys, 
and values.  Each section header is denoted by square brackets, and is 
followed by the key/value pairs. For example, to set the *job_type* key of 
the *[Main]* section to the value *process_search*, your config.ini file 
would include the lines:

.. code-block:: none

    [Main]
    job_type = process_search

AKMC
----

Parameters for the AKMC section of config.ini.

    **confidence**: The confidence (out of 1.0) criterion for moving to the next state.

        type: float

        default: ``0.99``

    **max_kmc_steps**: The maximum number of KMC transitions in a row.

        type: int

        default: ``100000``

    **server_side**: If true the server does not send out "process_search" jobs instead it manages individual dimer, minimization, and hessian calculations. This option is usually used when a a single "process_search" job will take a long time (hours or longer).

        type: boolean

        default: ``False``

    **confidence_scheme**: 

        type: string

        default: ``new``

        options:

            ``new``: 

            ``old``: 

    **thermally_accessible_window**: Processes with barriers within this number of kT above the lowest barrier will be used in the rate table and for confidence calculations.

        type: float

        default: ``20``

    **thermally_accessible_buffer**: Processes with barriers of thermally_accessible_window + thermally_accessible_buffer will be stored, in the event that they are thermally accessible later, but are not used in the rate table or for the confidence calculations. Processes with barriers higher than the sum of these two values will be discarded.

        type: float

        default: ``0``

    **confidence_correction**: 

        type: boolean

        default: ``False``

**confidence**

   default: 0.99

   The confidence (out of 1.0) criterion for moving to the next state.

**max_kmc_steps**

   default: 100000

   The maximum number of transitions per execution of the server.

**thermally_accessible_window**

   default: 20

   Processes with barriers within this number of kT above the lowest barrier will be used in the rate table and for confidence calculations.

**thermally_accessible_buffer**

   default: 0

   Processes with barriers of thermally_accessible_window + thermally_accessible_buffer will be stored, in the event that they are thermally accessible later, but are not used in the rate table or for the confidence calculations. Processes with barriers higher than the sum of these two values will be discarded.

**confidence_scheme**

   default: new

   

**confidence_correction**

   default: False

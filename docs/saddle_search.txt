Saddle Search
=============

A saddle search is initiated by making a local displacement of atoms from their position at the minimum of the current state. This displacement can be done using the different strategies indicated by the displace_type option, and the following parameters. If the user knows something about the local environment where reactions are likely to take place in the system, this information can be used to make saddle searches more efficient by getting them started in the right part of configuration space.

[Saddle Search] Options
-----------------------

**min_mode_method**: 

    default: ``dimer``

    options:

        ``dimer``: Use the :ref:`dimer <dimer>` min-mode method.

        ``lanczos``: Use the :ref:`Lanczos <lanczos>` min-mode method.

**converged_force**: When the maximum force (in eV/A) on any one atom is smaller than this value, the structure is considered converged onto a saddle point.

    default: ``0.01``

**max_energy**: The energy at which a saddle search is considered bad and terminated.

    default: ``20.0``

**max_step_size**: 

    default: ``0.2``

**max_iterations**: The maximum number of translation steps to be taken.

    default: ``1000``

**displace_radius**: Atoms within this distance of the epicenter will be displaced.

    default: ``5.0``

**displace_magnitude**: The standard deviation of the Gaussian displacement in each degree of freedom for the selected atoms.

    default: ``0.1``
    
**displace_min_norm**: The total length of the displacement vector is ensured to exceeds this value. Is useful when only a few degrees of freedoms are displaced to guarantee that the starting point for the saddle point search is significantly different from the initial minimum.

    default: ``0.0``
    
**displace_random_weight**: Relative probability to displace with a random epicenter.

    default: ``1.0``

**displace_not_FCC_HCP_weight**:  Relative probabiilty to displace with an epicenter that is not FCC or HCP coordinated.

    default: ``0.0``

**displace_least_coordinated_weight**:  Relative probability to displace with an epicenter that has a coordination number equal to the least-coordinated atom in the configuration. 

    default: ``0.0``

**displace_listed_weight**: Relative probability to displace with an epicenter listed in displace_atomlist. 

    default: ``0.0``

**displace_under_coordinated_weight**:  Relative probability to displace with an epicenter with a coordination equal to or less than displace_max_coordination.

    default: ``0.0``

**displace_atomlist**: The individual index should be seperated by a comma 10, 20,-1 would be the 10, 20 and the last atom.

    default: ``0``

**displace_max_coordination**: When using under_coordinated as the displacement type, choose only atoms with a coordination equal to or less than this.

    default: ``11``

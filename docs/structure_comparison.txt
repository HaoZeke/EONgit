Structure Comparison
====================

**use_covalent**: Use the covalent radii of atoms to determine neighbors.

    type: boolean

    default: ``False``

**energy_difference**: How close in energy two configurations must be to be considered energetically equivalent.

    type: float

    default: ``0.01``

**brute_neighbors**: Determine neighbors by brute force (use this with nonorthogonal boxes).

    type: boolean

    default: ``False``

**check_rotation**: Finds optimal overlap of structures via rotation before comparing them. Use this option in systems where structures can become rotated, such as nanoparticles.

    type: boolean

    default: ``False``

**neighbor_cutoff**: Atoms within this distance of each other are considered neighbors.

    type: float

    default: ``3.3``

**indistinguishable_atoms**: Use an algorithm to compare structures that does not distinguish between atoms of the same element. That is to say the numbering of the atoms does not affect the structural comparison.

    type: boolean

    default: ``True``

**distance_difference**: The maximum distance two mapped atoms may be for two configurations to be considered equivalent.

    type: float

    default: ``0.05``

**covalent_scale**: Multiply covalent radii by this amount before determining neighbors.

    type: float

    default: ``1.3``

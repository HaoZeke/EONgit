Process Search
--------------

The AKMC method can ask clients to do a saddle search, find connecting minima,
and calculate prefactors all within the Process Search job type.

**minimize_first** 

    Default: false

    Every time a process search is run by a client the reactant will be
    minimized first before doing any saddle searches.

**prefactor_min** 

    Default: 10e8

    Minimum value for a resonable prefactor.

**prefactor_max** 
    
    Default: 10e20

    Maximum value for a resonable prefactor.

**default_prefactor**

    Default: 0

    Calculate prefactor if zero, otherwise use given value instead of doing a
    full prefactor calculation.

**minimization_offset**

    Default: 0.2
    
    After a saddle is found, images are placed on either side of the saddle along
    the mode and minimized to ensure that the saddle is connected to the original
    minimum and to locate the product state. This is the distance those images 
    are displaced from the saddle.

Optimizers
==============

The eon client provides two optimizers quick-min and conjugate gradients. These
options are in the **[Optimizers]** section. 

**method**:
    
    Default: cg
    
    The optimization method to use.
    
    Options:
        
        *cg*: Conjugate gradient
        *qm*: Quickmin


**max_iterations**:

    Default: 1000

    The maximum number of optimization iterations that the will be performed.

**converged_force**:

    Default: 0.005

    When the maximum force (in eV/A) on any one atom is smaller than
    this value, the structure is considered minimized.

**max_move**:

    Default: 0.2

    Maximum distance that an atom may be moved in a single optimization step.

**time_step**:

    Default: 0.1

    The dynamical timestep for the quickmin algorithm.


**finite_diff_step**:

    Default: 0.001

    The finite difference step size.

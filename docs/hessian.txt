Hessian
=======

The Hessian matrix, in mass-weighted coordinates, is used to evaluate prefactors in hamonic transition state theory rate calculations.

[Hessian] Options
=================

**type**: The Hessian to be calculated has to be one of reactant, saddle, or product. This option only matters for the "hessian" job. Hessian are also calculated in the "process_search" job.

    default: ``reactant``

**min_displacement**: Minimum amount that an atom has to move to be included in the Hessian calculation.

    default: ``0.25``

**within_radius**: Atoms within this radius of moving atoms are included in the Hessian.

    default: ``5.0``

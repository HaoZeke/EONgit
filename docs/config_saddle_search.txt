Saddle Search
-------------

A saddle search is initiated by making a local displacement of atoms from their
position at the minimum of the current state.  This displacement can be done
using the different strategies indicated by the **displace_type** option, and the
following parameters.  If the user knows something about the local environment
where reactions are likely to take place in the system, this information can be
used to make saddle searches more efficient by getting them started in the
right part of configuration space.

**displace_type**

    Default: Random

    Options:

        *random*: Select an atom at random from the free atoms in the
        configuration.

        *least_coordinated*: Determine the lowest coordination number of all
        atoms in the configuration and select one atom at random with that
        coordination number.

        *under_coordinated*: Select a random atom with coordination less than
        *displace_max_coordination*.
        
        *listed_atoms*: Select an atom from the list passed as *displace_atomlist*
        
        *not_FCC_HCP_coordinated*: Select an atom that is not in a local HCP or
        FCC coordination.

	*client_least_coordinated*: Displacement is made on the client centered on
	an atom with the minimal coordination.

        *client_not_FCC_HCP_coordinated*: Displacement is made on the client 
	centered on an atom that is not in a local HCP or FCC coordination.

	*client_last_atom*: Displacement is made on the client centered on the 
	last atom in the configuration.


**max_iterations**

    Default: 1000
    
    The maximum number of translation steps to be taken.

**displace_radius** 

    Default: 5.0

    Atoms within this distance of the epicenter will be displaced.

**displace_magnitude**

    Default: 0.01

    The standard deviation of the magnitude of the displacement.

**displace_min_norm**

    Default: 0.0

    The total length of the displacement vector is ensured to exceeds this value.
    Is useful when only a few degrees of freedoms are displaced to guarantee 
    that the starting point for the saddle point search is significantly different
    from the initial minimum.  

**displace_max_coordination**

    Default: 11

    When using *under_coordinated* as the displacement type, choose only atoms with
    a coordination equal to or less than this.

**min_mode_method**

    Default: dimer

    Options:

        *dimer*: Use the dimer min-mode method.

        *lanczos*: Use the Lanczos min-mode method.

**max_energy** 

    Default: 20.0
    The energy at which a saddle search is considered bad and terminated.
    
**displace_atomlist**

    Default: None

    The individual index should be seperated by a ','
    10, 20,-1 would be the 10, 20 and the last atom.

**client_max_single_displace**
    Default: 10.

    Only functional when displacement is done on the client.  Defines the
    maximal allowed absolute value for a single component in the
    displacement vector.

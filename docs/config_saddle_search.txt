Saddle Search
-------------

A saddle search is initiated by making a local displacement of atoms from their
position at the minimum of the current state.  This displacement can be done
using the different strategies indicated by the **displace_type** option, and the
following parameters.  If the user knows something about the local environment
where reactions are likely to take place in the system, this information can be
used to make saddle searches more efficient by getting them started in the
right part of configuration space.

**displace_type**

    Default: Random

    Options:

        *random*: Select an atom at random from the free atoms in the
        configuration.

        *least_coordinated*: Determine the lowest coordination number of all
        atoms in the configuration and select one atom at random with that
        coordination number.

        *under_coordinated*: Select a random atom with coordination less than
        *displace_max_coordination*.

**max_iterations**

    Default: 1000
    
    The maximum number of translation steps to be taken.

**displace_radius** 

    Default: 5.0

    Atoms within this distance of the epicenter will be displaced.

**displace_magnitude**

    Default: 0.01

    The standard deviation of the magnitude of the displacement.

**displace_max_coordination**

    Default: 11

    When using *under_coordinated* as the displacement type, choose only atoms with
    a coordination equal to or less than this.

**min_mode_method**

    Default: dimer

    Options:

        *dimer*: Use the dimer min-mode method.

        *lanczos*: Use the Lanczos min-mode method.

**max_energy** 

    Default: 20.0
    The energy at which a saddle search is considered bad and terminated.

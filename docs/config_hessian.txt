-------

Options for controlling how Hessian matricies are calculated.

**type**

   default: reactant

   The Hessian to be calculated has to be one of reactant, saddle, or product.

**finite_dist**

   default: 0.001

   Finite difference distance between forces used to construct the Hessian.

**min_displacement**

   default: 0.25

   Minimum amount that an atom has to move to be included in the Hessian calculation.

**within_radius**

   default: 5

   Atoms within this radius of moving atoms are included in the Hessian.

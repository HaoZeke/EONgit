Hessian
-------

Options for controlling how Hessian matricies are calculated.

**type** 

    Default: reactant

    The Hessian to be calculated has to be one of *reactant*, *saddle*, or
    *product*.

**min_displacement** 

    Default: 0.25

    Minimum amount that an atom has to move to be included in the Hessian
    calculation.

**within_radius** 

    Default: 5.0

    Atoms within this radius of moving atoms are included in the Hessian.

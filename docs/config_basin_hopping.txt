Basin Hopping
-------------

Basin hopping is a Monte Carlo method in which the energy of each configuration is taken to be the energy of a local minimization.

**steps**

   default: 10000

   Number at steps to take at the temeprature assigned.

**max_displacement**

   default: 0.5

   Max displacement in each degree of freedom.

**max_displacement_algorithm**

   default: standard

   The algorithm used to assign max displacement of each atom.

   options:

       **standard**: The max displacement of all the atoms will be the value assigned in max_displacement.

       **linear**: The max displacement of each atom will be linearly correlated to its distance from the geometric center, with the overal maximum displacement being the value assigned in max_displacement.

       **quadratic**: The max displacement of each atom will be quadratically correlated to its distance from the geometric center, with the overal maximum displacement being the value assigned in max_displacement.

**displacement_distribution**

   default: uniform

   The distribution used for the displacement of each atom.

   options:

       **uniform**: A random number is selected between 0 and max_displacement

       **gaussian**: max_displacement serves as the width of a gaussian distribution used to select displacements

**quenching_steps**

   default: 0

   Number at steps at 0 temperature.

**single_atom_displace**

   default: False

   Displace only one atom per step.

**stay_minimized**

   default: False

   Displace minimized structures.

**swap_probability**

   default: 0

   The probability in range [0,1.0] that a swapping step takes place instead of a displacement step. The swap step selects two atoms of different elements and switches them.

**jump_max**

   default: 0

   The number of consecutive rejected steps after which jump steps should be taken. This serves to provide a more global search when the structure is stuck in a certain basin. The number of jump steps is assigned in jump_steps. See paper on the Basin Hopping with Occasional Jumping algorithm by Iwamatsu and Okabe.

**jump_steps**

   default: 0

   The number of jump steps to take after the jump_max number of consecutive rejections have taken place.

**md_first**

   default: False

   

**md_probability**

   default: 0.9

   The probability that molecular dynamics is run before the first step is taken. The parameters for molecular dynamics can be set in the [Dynamics] section. As default, the temperature specified in [Main] will be used, or another temperature can be specificed in MD_temp.

**md_temp**

   default: 300

   The temperature to use for the molecular dynamics steps that occur before basin hopping steps.

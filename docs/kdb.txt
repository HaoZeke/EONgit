Kinetic Database 
================

One of the bottlenecks in an aKMC simulation is performing the saddle point 
searches.  The kinetic database is used to ameliorate this cost by 
storing information about processes as they are found and using it to predict 
future saddle points.

In the following figure, the hydrogen of a carboxyl group on an Au(111) surface 
transfers to the other oxygen (a). In this process, the hydrogen is determined 
to be the only moving atom, and the two oxygen atoms to be its neighbors. The 
other atoms are stripped from the system and the resulting configurations are 
stored in the database (b). If in the future the system passes through a state 
with a local configuration closely resembling either minimum of (b), the 
kinetic database will suggest a saddle to converge with a dimer search. The 
dimer starts with this suggested configuration and mode, and if it is a good 
suggestion, converges very rapidly to the saddle.

Dependencies
------------
The kinetic database is a separate application from eOn. It can be found in 
*vtstscripts* located `here <http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/vtsttools/scripts/>`_.
This is a Perl script and so requires that Perl be installed, and the 
vtstscripts directory must be in your path.


Configuration
-------------
Settings for the kinetic database can be altered in your *config.ini* file
under the **[kdb]** section. These are the options:

| ``use_kdb`` 
|    **default**: False
|    **description**: Turn kdb on/off.
    
| ``wait`` 
|     **default**: False
|     **description**: Wait for the query to finish before submitting jobs (for debugging purposes).
    
| ``keep`` 
|     **default**: False
|     **description**: Keep the saddle suggestions (for debugging purposes).
    
Example configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++
A typical configuration using the kinetic database might look like this:

.. code-block:: none

    [kdb]
    use_kdb = True
    wait = False
    keep = False

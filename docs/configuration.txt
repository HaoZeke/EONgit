Configuration
================

EON uses a single configuration file, *config.ini*. The file consists of sections,
keys, and values. The sections are delimited with section headers in square brackets.
For example, **[AKMC]** is the section header for the AKMC method options. Within
each section is a list of configuration options and their corresponding values.

The following is a list of all sections, keys, possible and default values, and
descriptions of each.

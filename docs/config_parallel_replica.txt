Parallel Replica
----------------

Parallel Replica Dynamics (PRD) is the simplest and the most accurate way to do accelerated-MD simulation. The only assumption made in this method is that the reactions satisfy first order kinetics.

**time_step**

   default: 1

   The length of each MD step in femtoseconds.

**auto_stop**

   default: False

   Whether or not stop the job when a new state is found. For boinc communicator this value should be set to false.

**steps**

   default: 1000

   The number of MD steps to run.

**dephase_steps**

   default: 200

   Number of steps used to decorrelate the replica trajectories. The momenta will be inversed when reaching the dividing surface to prevent transitions occurring during this period.

**check_period**

   default: 500

   How frequently the state of system is checked. Every check_period steps, the current structure and the initial one will be compared to tell whether a newstate has been reached. Also note when you set refine as true, the code will keep a buffer array consisting of check_period/record_resolution+1 atomic configurations, which may increase the usage of memory.

**refine_transition_time**

   default: True

   Whether or not the transition time is refined. When this option is turned on, the code will keep an array consisted by check_period/record_resolution+1 atomic configurations. A Binary search algorithm is employed to determine the transition step. Otherwise the transition step would be the first in which a new state was found. This function reduces the need for a smaller check_period. And the accuracy of transition time is record_resolution*timestep.

**record_resolution**

   default: True

   How often the system is recorded to the buffer array when the refine_transition_time option is activated. Increasing the value of record_resolution lowers the accuracy of the transition time estimate but also reduces memory usage and speeds up refinement of the transition step.

**post_transition_steps**

   default: 500

   Number of MD steps which will be performed after a new state has been found. A state check will be employed after these post_transition_steps to confirm that the state is stable. This additional check helps avoid meta-stable states. A value similar to dephase_steps is recommended.

**thermo_type**

   default: andersen

   

   options:

       **andersen**: Andersen thermostat with Verlet algorithm

       **nose_hoober**: Nose-Hover thermostat with Verlet algorithm

       **langevin**: Langevin thermostat with Verlet algorithm

**andersen_alpha**

   default: 0.2

   The collision strength in the Andersen thermostat

**andersen_collision_steps**

   default: 10

   The collision period (in MD steps) for the Andersen thermostat.

**nose_mass**

   default: 1

   The effective mass of the additional degree of freedom in the Nose-Hover thermostat, which determines the rate of heat transfer.

**langevin_friction**

   default: 0.01

   The damping coefficient for langevin dynamics.

**bias_potential**

   default: None

   

**bb_dvmax**


   The magnitude of the bond-boost bias potential. It should be smaller than the barrier of any transition.

**bb_rmd_steps**

   default: None

   Number of MD steps used to determine the equilibrium bond length before the bias potential is added.

**bb_stretch_threshold**


   Defines the bond-boost dividing surface. It should be smaller than the maximum fractional nearest-neighbor bond stretch or compression at any transition state.

**bb_ds_curvature**


   The curvature near the bond-boost dividing surface, it should has a value <= 1. We recommend the value to be 0.9-0.98.

**bb_rcut**


   All bonds which belong to the tagged atoms and are shorter than a cutoff of rcut will be included in the bond-boost potential.

Optimizers
----------

The eon client provides two optimizers quick-min and conjugate gradients. These options are in the [Optimizers] section.

**opt_method**

   default: cg

   The optimization method to use.

   options:

       **cg**: Conjugate gradient

       **qm**: Quickmin

       **box**: Optimizes the atom positions and box using quickmin

**max_iterations**

   default: 1000

   The maximum number of optimization iterations that the will be performed.

**converged_force**

   default: 0.005

   When the maximum force (in eV/A) on any one atom is smaller than this value, the structure is considered minimized.

**max_move**

   default: 0.2

   Maximum distance that an atom may be moved in a single optimization step.

**time_step**

   default: 0.1

   The dynamical timestep for the quickmin algorithm.

**finite_dist**

   default: 0.001

   The finite difference step size.

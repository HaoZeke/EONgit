Optimizers
----------

The eon client provides two optimizers quick-min and conjugate gradients. These options are in the [Optimizers] section.

    **converged_force**: When the maximum force (in eV/A) on any one atom is smaller than this value, the structure is considered minimized.

        type: float

        default: ``0.01``

    **max_move**: Maximum distance that an atom may be moved in a single optimization step.

        type: float

        default: ``0.2``

    **time_step**: The dynamical timestep for the quickmin algorithm.

        type: float

        default: ``0.1``

    **max_iterations**: The maximum number of optimization iterations that the will be performed.

        type: int

        default: ``1000``

    **opt_method**: The optimization method to use.

        type: string

        default: ``cg``

        options:

            ``box``: Optimizes the atom positions and box using quickmin

            ``cg``: Conjugate gradient

            ``qm``: Quickmin

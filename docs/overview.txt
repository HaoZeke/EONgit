eOn: Long timescale dynamics
================================

A common problem in theoretical chemistry, condensed matter physics and 
materials science is the calculation of the time evolution of an atomic scale 
system where, for example, chemical reactions and/or diffusion occur. 
Generally the events of interest are quite rare (many orders of magnitude 
slower than the vibrational movements of the atoms), and therefore direct 
simulations, tracking every movement of the atoms, would take thousands of 
years of computer calculations on the fastest present day computer before a 
single event of interest can be expected to occur, hence the name eon, which is
an indefinitely long period of time.

Our research group is interested in calculating the long time dynamics of 
systems. We have developed a method for doing this through distributed 
computing where a server sends out small data packets for calculation to 
clients, e.g. over the internet. So, instead of the entire calculation being 
done on a single processor, it is done on many client computers worldwide. 
After finishing its calculation, each client computer sends it's results back 
to the server, which summarizes the results and sends out more jobs.

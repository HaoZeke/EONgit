Eon is divided up into two separate programs: a server and a client. The client
does most of the computation (`e.g.` saddle searches, minimizations, and
molecular dynamics) while the server creates the input for the client and
processes its results.

Dependencies
------------

* Server
    * `python <http://www.python.org/download>`_ (>=2.4)
    * `numpy <http://new.scipy.org/download.html>`_ (>=1.2.1)
    * (optional, for MPI communicator) `mpi4py <http://mpi4py.scipy.org/>`_

* Client
    * make
    * gcc (>=4.0)
    * (optional) gfortran or Intel Fortran Compiler

Server Installation
-------------------

It is most convenient to install eon to a directory in your ``$HOME`` folder.
For the purposes of this guide we will assume that you have installed eon to
``$HOME/eon``. You will want to either add this directory to your ``$PATH`` or
make a symlink from the main eon program (``eon.py``) to a directory that is in
your ``$PATH``.

Client Installation
-------------------

The client source code is located in a folder named ``client`` under the main
eon directory.  For most situations you will only need to run the make command
and a binary named ``client`` will be built in this directory.

If you wish to use the potentials that depend on fortran you will need a
fortran compiler. However, this is optional and you can compile the client
without fortran support by running the command ``make NO_FORTRAN=1``. If you
are using gfortran the supplied Makefile should work out of the box. If you are
using the Intel Fortran Compiler (ifort) you will need to edit the Makefile to
change ``FC`` (fortran compiler), ``FFLAGS`` (fortran compiler flags), and
``FAR`` (fortran archiver) variables to work for your system.

For most setups the binary ``client`` should be copied to a directory in your
``$PATH`` and named ``eonclient``. Otherwise you will need to give the path to
the client binary in your ``config.ini``.

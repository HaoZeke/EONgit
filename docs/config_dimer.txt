Dimer
-----

Options for controlling the dimer minimum mode finding method on the client side.

**seperation**

   default: 0.001

   Seperation between dimer images.

**finite_angles**

   default: 0.005

   Finite difference angle over which the dimer is rotated to find the lowest curvature.

**rotations_min**

   default: 1

   Minimum number of rotations allowed for the dimer in each step.

**rotations_max**

   default: 8

   Maximum number of rotations allowed for the dimer in each step.

**torque_min**

   default: 0.1

   Minimum torque above which the dimer rotates only once and below which is does not rotate.

**torque_max**

   default: 1

   Maximum torque above which the dimer rotates up to rotations_max times.

**improved**

   default: False

   Improvements to the dimer method from Kastner.

**converged_rotation**

   default: 5

   Dimer is considered converged if it rotates fewer degrees than this.

**opt_method**

   default: sd

   Optimization algorithm to choose the dimer rotation direction

   options:

       **sd**: steepest descent, rotate along the rotational force.

       **cg**: conjudate gradient, rotate along conjugate directions.

       **lbfgs**: quasi-Newton method [not implemeted yet].

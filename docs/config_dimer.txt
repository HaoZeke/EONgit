Dimer
-----

Options for controlling the dimer minimum mode finding method on the client side.

**separation** 

    Default: 0.001

    Separation between dimer images. 

**finite_diff_angle**

    Default: 0.005

    Finite difference angle over which the dimer is rotated to find the lowest
    curvature.

**rotations_min** 

    Default: 1

    Minimum number of rotations allowed for the dimer in each step.

**rotations_max** 

    Default: 8

    Maximum number of rotations allowed for the dimer in each step.

**torque_min** 

    Default: 0.1

    Minimum torque above which the dimer rotates only once and below
    which is does not rotate.

**torque_max** 
    
    Default: 1.0

    Maximum torque above which the dimer rotates up to rotations_max times.

**improved** 

    Default: false

    Improvements to the dimer method from Kastner.

**converged_rotation**

    Default: 5 [degrees]

    Dimer is considered converged if it rotates fewer degrees than this.

Basin Hopping
=============

Basin hopping is a Monte Carlo method in which the energy of each configuration is taken to be the energy of a local minimization.

These are options that go in the **[Basin Hopping]** section of "config.ini".

**max_displacement**

    Default: *0.5*

    The displacement along each degree of freedom is in the interval **[-max_displacement, 
    max_displacement]**.

**max_displacement_algorithm**

    Default: *standard*

    The algorithm used to assign max displacement of each atom.  In
    the standard algorithm, the max displacement of all the atoms will
    be the value assigned in **max_displacement**.  The linear and
    quadratic algorithms assign the max displacement of each atom as a
    function of its distance from the geometric center, with the
    overal maximum displacement being the value assigned in
    **max_displacement**.

**steps**

    Default: *10000*

    Number of steps taken at the temperature assigned.

**quenching_steps**

    Default: *0*

    Number of steps taken at 0 Kelvin to quench the lowest energy
    configuration.

**single_atom_displace**

    Default: *false*

    When **True**, only one random atom is displaced in each step.

**stay_minimized**

    Default: *false*

    When *true*, displacement is applied to the minimized structure
    after each step.

**number_of_minima**

    Default: *50*

    The number of lowest energy structures that are saved in the minima
    directory.

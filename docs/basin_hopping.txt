Basin Hopping
=============

Basin hopping is a Monte Carlo method in which the energy of each configuration is taken to be the energy of a local minimization.

These are options that go in the **[Basin Hopping]** section of "config.ini".

**max_displacement**

    Default: *0.5*

    The displacement along each degree of freedom is in the interval [-max_displacement, 
max_displacement].

**steps**

    Default: *10000*

    Total number of steps.

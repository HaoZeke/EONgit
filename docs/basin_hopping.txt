=============
Basin Hopping
=============

Basin hopping is a Monte Carlo method in which the energy of each configuration
is taken to be the energy of a local minimization.

These are options that go in the **[Basin Hopping]** section of "config.ini".

**max_displacement**

    Default: *0.5*

    The displacement along each degree of freedom is in the interval **[-max_displacement, 
    max_displacement]**.

**max_displacement_algorithm**

    Default: *standard*

    The algorithm used to assign max displacement of each atom.  In
    the standard algorithm, the max displacement of all the atoms will
    be the value assigned in **max_displacement**.  The linear and
    quadratic algorithms assign the max displacement of each atom as a
    function of its distance from the geometric center, with the
    overal maximum displacement being the value assigned in
    **max_displacement**. For more information see the paper by Kim et al [#kim]_.

**displacement_distribution**

    Default: *uniform*

    The distribution used for the displacement of atoms.  When
    *uniform*, a random number is selected between 0 and the
    **max_displacement**.  When *gaussian*, the **max_displacement**
    serves as the width of a gaussian distribution which is used to
    select the displacements.

**steps**

    Default: *10000*

    Number of steps taken at the temperature assigned.

**quenching_steps**

    Default: *0*

    Number of steps taken at 0 Kelvin to quench the lowest energy
    configuration.

**single_atom_displace**

    Default: *false*

    When **True**, only one random atom is displaced in each step.

**stay_minimized**

    Default: *false*

    When *true*, displacement is applied to the minimized structure
    after each step. See paper by White and Mayne [#white]_.

**swap_probability**

    Default: *0.0*

    The probability in range [0,1.0] that a swapping step takes place
    instead of a displacement step.  The swap step selects two atoms
    of different elements and switches them.

**jump_max**

    Default: *10*

    The number of consecutive rejected steps after which jump steps
   should be taken.  This serves to provide a more global search when
   the structure is "stuck" in a certain basin.  The number of jump
   steps is assigned in **jump_steps**.  See paper on the Basin
   Hopping with Occasional Jumping algorithm by Iwamatsu and Okabe
   [#iwamatsu]_.

**jump_steps**

    Default: *0*

    The number of jump steps to take after the **jump_max** number of
    consecutive rejections have taken place. See paper on the Basin
   Hopping with Occasional Jumping algorithm by Iwamatsu and Okabe
   [#iwamatsu]_.

**MD_first**

    Default: *False*

    When *true*, molecular dynamics is run before the first step is
    taken.  The parameters for molecular dynamics can be set in the
    **[Dynamics]** section.  As default, the temperature specified in
    **[Main]** will be used, or another temperature can be specificed
    in **MD_temp**.

**MD_Temp**

    Default: *temperature in **[Main]***

    The temperature to use for the molecular dynamics that occurs
    before basin hopping steps.

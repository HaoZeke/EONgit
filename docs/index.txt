EON: Long timescale dynamics
================================

The EON program contains a set of algorithms used primarily to model the
evolution of atomic scale systems over long time scales.  Standard molecular
dynamics algorithms, based upon solving Newton's equations, are limited by the
femtosecond time scale of atomic vibrations.  EON simulations are designed for
rare event systems where the interesting dynamics can be described by fast
transition between stable states.  In each algorithm, the residence time in the
stable states is modeled with statistical mechanics, and the important
state-to-state dynamics are modeled stochastically.

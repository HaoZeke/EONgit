Hyperdynamics
=============

The hyperdynamics method uses a bias potential which should be zero at transition state and positive in minima in order to increase the rate of transitions. [#hyperdynamics_ref]_ The hyperdynamics time step :math:`\delta t` can be obtained from the molecular dynamics simulation time step :math:`\delta t^b` multiplied by a boost factor :math:`e^{\beta \Delta V}`, where :math:`{\Delta V}` is the bias potential.

There are several possible forms of bias potential. In EON, we adapt the bond-boost method, [#bondboost_ref]_ where the bias potential is controlled by the maximal (fractional) change in any bond length in the system.  This is a fairly good bias potential for systems in which the dynamics is governed by bond breaking and forming events.

The hyperdynamics method is integraded with the parallel Replica method in EON. You can run hyperdynamics by parallel replica job with **[Hyper dynamics]** options turned on. 

These are options that go in the **[Hyperdynamics]** section of the config.ini file.

**bias_potential**: 

    default: ``none``

    options:

        ``bond_boost``: bond boost method from Miron and Fichthorn

        ``none``: with no bias potential, run regular MD

**bb_dvmax**: 

    default: ``0.0``

    The magnitude of the bond-boost bias potential. It should be smaller than the barrier of any transition.

**bb_rmd_steps**: 

    default: ``0``

    Number of MD steps used to determine the equilibrium bond length before the bias potential is added.

**bb_rcut**: 

    default: ``3.0``

    All bonds which belong to the tagged atoms and are shorter than a cutoff of rcut will be included in the bond-boost potential.

**bb_strech_threshold**: 

    default: ``0.0001``

    Defines the bond-boost dividing surface. It should be smaller than the maximum fractional nearest-neighbor bond stretch or compression at any transition state.

**bb_ds_curvature**: 

    default: ``3.95``

    The curvature near the bond-boost dividing surface, it should has a value <= 1. We recommend the value to be 0.9-0.98.

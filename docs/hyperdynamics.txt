Hyperdynamics
=============

The hyperdynamics method uses a bias potential which should be zero at
transition states and positive in minima in order to accelerate the rate of
transitions. [#hyperdynamics_ref]_ The hyperdynamics time step :math:`\delta t`
can be obtained from the molecular dynamics simulation time step :math:`\delta
t^b` multiplied by a boost factor :math:`e^{\beta \Delta V}`, where
:math:`{\Delta V}` is the bias potential.

There are several possible forms of bias potential. In EON, we have implemented
the bond-boost method, [#bondboost_ref]_ where the bias potential is controlled
by the maximal (fractional) change in any bond length in the system.  This is a
good bias potential for systems in which the dynamics is governed by bond
breaking and forming events.

You can run a hyperdynamics job by setting the **bias_potential** option.
It may be run with the ``dynamics`` or ``parallel_replica`` job.

[Hyperdynamics] Options
=======================

**bias_potential**: 

    default: ``none``

    options:

        ``bond_boost``: bond boost method from Miron and Fichthorn

        ``none``: with no bias potential, run regular MD

**bb_dvmax**: 

    default: ``0.0``

    The magnitude of the bond-boost bias potential. It should be smaller than the barrier of any transition.

**bb_rmd_steps**: 

    default: ``100``

    Number of MD steps used to determine the equilibrium bond length before the bias potential is added.

**bb_rcut**: 

    default: ``3.0``

    All bonds which belong to the tagged atoms and are shorter than a cutoff of rcut will be included in the bond-boost potential.

**bb_stretch_threshold**: 

    default: ``0.2``

    Defines the bond-boost dividing surface. It should be smaller than the
    maximum fractional nearest-neighbor bond stretch or compression at any
    transition state.

**bb_ds_curvature**: 

    default: ``0.95``

    The curvature near the bond-boost dividing surface, it should has a value
    <= 1. We recommend the value to be 0.9-0.98.

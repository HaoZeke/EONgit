The Hyper-MD method is one of the accelerated dynamics method developed by Arthur F. Voter.
Bias potential which goes to zero near transition state is added to the potential surface to accelerate
the dynamical evolution of the system. The real time increment :math:`\delta t` can be obtain from the corresponding 
simulation time step :math:`\delta t^b` multiplied by boost factor :math:`e^{\beta \Delta V}`. 

There are several types of Hyper-MD method regarding the form of bias potential. In EON, we adapt the
bond-boost-method developed by Kristen A. Fichthorn, where the bias potential is derived from the bond-breaking
picture.

The Hyperdynamics method is integraded with Parallel Replica method in EON. You can run 
Hyperdynamics by Parallel Replica job with **[Hyperdynamics]** options turned on. 

These are options that go in the **[Hyperdynamics]** section of the config.ini file.

**bias_potential**: 

    type: string

    default: ``none``

    options:

        ``bond_boost``: bond boost method from Miron and Fichthorn

        ``none``: with no bias potential, run regular MD

**bb_dvmax**: 

    type: float

    default: ``0.0``

    The magnitude of the bond-boost bias potential. It should be smaller than the barrier of any transition.

**bb_rmd_steps**: 

    type: int

    default: ``0``

    Number of MD steps used to determine the equilibrium bond length before the bias potential is added.

**bb_rcut**: 

    type: float

    default: ``3.0``

    All bonds which belong to the tagged atoms and are shorter than a cutoff of rcut will be included in the bond-boost potential.

**bb_strech_threshold**: 

    type: float

    default: ``0.0001``

    Defines the bond-boost dividing surface. It should be smaller than the maximum fractional nearest-neighbor bond stretch or compression at any transition state.

**bb_ds_curvature**: 

    type: float

    default: ``3.95``

    The curvature near the bond-boost dividing surface, it should has a value <= 1. We recommend the value to be 0.9-0.98.

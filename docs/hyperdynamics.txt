Our parallel replica can also be combined with
Hyperdynamics by using Bond-Boost method. You can use this feature by setting
**bias_potential** to *bond_boost* in the **[Hyperdynamics]** section.

The temperature for the dynamics run is set in the **[Main]** section.

For detailed information about Hyperdynamics, please refer to
papers by:

     "Accelerated molecular-dynamics of rare events with the bond-boost method"
                      R. A. Miron and K. A. Fichthorn, J. Chem. Phys. 119, 6210 (2003)

These are options that go in the **[Hyperdynamics]** section of the config.ini file.

**bias_potential**: 

    type: string

    default: ``none``

    options:

        ``bond_boost``: bond boost method from Miron and Fichthorn

        ``none``: with no bias potential, run regular MD

**bb_dvmax**: 

    type: float

    default: ``0.0``

    The magnitude of the bond-boost bias potential. It should be smaller than the barrier of any transition.

**bb_rmd_steps**: 

    type: int

    default: ``0``

    Number of MD steps used to determine the equilibrium bond length before the bias potential is added.

**bb_rcut**: 

    type: float

    default: ``3.0``

    All bonds which belong to the tagged atoms and are shorter than a cutoff of rcut will be included in the bond-boost potential.

**bb_strech_threshold**: 

    type: float

    default: ``0.0001``

    Defines the bond-boost dividing surface. It should be smaller than the maximum fractional nearest-neighbor bond stretch or compression at any transition state.

**bb_ds_curvature**: 

    type: float

    default: ``3.95``

    The curvature near the bond-boost dividing surface, it should has a value <= 1. We recommend the value to be 0.9-0.98.

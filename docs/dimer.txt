Dimer
=====

The dimer method for determining the lowest eigenmode.

[Dimer] Options
===============

**opt_method**: Optimization algorithm to choose the dimer rotation direction

    default: ``cg``

    options:

        ``sd``: steepest descent, rotate along the rotational force.

        ``cg``: conjugate gradient, rotate along conjugate directions.

        ``lbfgs``: Limited Memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Quasi-Newton optimizer

**converged_angle**: Dimer is considered converged if it rotates fewer degrees than this.

    default: ``5.0``

**rotations_max**: Maximum number of rotations allowed for the dimer in each step.

    default: ``10``

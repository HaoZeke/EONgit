[Dimer] Options
===============


**improved**: Improvements to the dimer method from Kastner.

    default: ``False``

**torque_min**: Minimum torque above which the dimer rotates only once and below which is does not rotate.

    default: ``0.1``

**opt_method**: Optimization algorithm to choose the dimer rotation direction

    default: ``sd``

    options:

        ``sd``: steepest descent, rotate along the rotational force.

        ``cg``: conjudate gradient, rotate along conjugate directions.

        ``lbfgs``: Limited Memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno QuasiNewton optimizer

**torque_max**: Maximum torque above which the dimer rotates up to rotations_max times.

    default: ``1.0``

**finite_angle**: Finite difference angle over which the dimer is rotated to find the lowest curvature.

    default: ``0.005``

**rotations_max**: Maximum number of rotations allowed for the dimer in each step.

    default: ``8``

**rotations_min**: Minimum number of rotations allowed for the dimer in each step.

    default: ``1``

**converged_angle**: Dimer is considered converged if it rotates fewer degrees than this.

    default: ``5.0``

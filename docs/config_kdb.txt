KDB
---

One of the bottlenecks in an aKMC simulation is performing the saddle point searches. The kinetic database is used to ameliorate this cost by storing information about processes as they are found and using it to predict future saddle points.

    **use_kdb**: Turn Kdb on/off.

        type: boolean

        default: ``False``

    **insertpath**: The path to kdbinsert.py in tsase/kdb.

        type: string

        default: ``kdbinsert.py``

    **querypath**: The path to kdbquery.py in tsase/kdb.

        type: string

        default: ``False``

    **wait**: Wait for the query to finish before submitting jobs (for debugging purposes).

        type: boolean

        default: ``False``

    **keep**: Keep the saddle suggestions (for debugging purposes).

        type: boolean

        default: ``False``

    **Kdb_only**: Only use kdb in an akmc simulation, no random searches.

        type: boolean

        default: ``False``

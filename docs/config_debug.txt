Parameters that are generally used to help debug calculations added under
**[Debug]** section.

**keep_bad_saddles** 

    Default: false

    Keep data about bad saddles. If true, the result files for failed saddle
    searches are kept in the *badprocdata* directory within the state
    directory for that search. 
    
    Each bad search will have 5 files: the starting structure (reactant.con), the saddle (saddle.con), the reaction product (product.con), the lowest eigenmode at the saddle (mode.dat), and a file detailing the results of the saddle search (results.dat). The reason for failure can be found in the results.dat under the field termination_reason. The termination reasons are:

    =====  ===== 
    0      Success
    1      Unknown Error
    2      A convex region of the potential could not be found
    3      The energy of the saddle search exceeded :ref:`max_energy <saddle_max_energy>`
    4      Unused
    5      The number of iterations in the saddle search exceeded :ref:`max_iterations <saddle_max_iterations>`
    6      The saddle is not connected to the initial minimum
    7      The prefactor is either not defined or is outside of reasonable bounds
    8      The barrier found exceeded :ref:`max_energy <saddle_max_energy>`
    9      The saddle is not connected to the initial minimum, and one or both of the minimizations from the saddle did not converge 
    10     Calculation of the hessian at the reactant, product, or saddle failed
    =====  =====

**keep_all_result_files** 

    Default: false

    Stores all result files in main_directory/results

**register_extra_results**

    Default: false

    Register processes found for a state after leaving that state.

**use_mean_time** 

    Default: false

    Select transition times from the mean of the exponential distribution of escape times.

**target_trajectory** 

    Default: None

    Follow the state-to-state trajectory of another akmc simulation.

**write_movies**

    Default: False

    Causes the client to output movies of minimizations and saddle searches.

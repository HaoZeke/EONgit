These are the options that go in the 'Main' section of config.ini

**job**

   default: process_search

   The type of job to execute.

   options:

       **akmc**: Run an adaptive kinetic monte carlo simulation.

       **parallel_replica**: Calculate the rare-event dynamics of the system by combining transitions observed from multiple trajectories run in parallel.

       **process_search**: Combined saddle search, minimizations, and prefactor calculations. Used by the aKMC method.

       **saddle_search**: Do a saddle point search using a minimum mode method.

       **minimization**: Find the minimum from an initial configuration.

       **hessian**: Calculate the Hessian matrix for the specified configuration in a process.

       **dimer_dr**: Rye is changing this.

       **dimer_rotation**: Rye is changing this.

       **displacement_sampling**: Job to sample different displacement methods and parameters to see which are the most efficient.

       **basin_hopping**: Search for global minimum using basin hopping method.

**temperature**

   default: 300

   The temperature that the job will run at.

**random_seed**

   default: -1

   Takes an integer number for the random seed. If this number is less than zero the current time is used as the random seed.

**potential**

   default: pot LJ

   the type of potential to execute

   options:

       **lj**: Lennard-Jones potential in reduced units.

       **morse_pt**: Morse potential for platinum.

       **emt**: Effective medium theory, for metals.

       **edip**: Environment-Dependent Interatomic Potential, for carbon.

       **vasp**: Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Program (VASP) interface.

       **tersoff_si**: Tersoff pair potential with angular terms, for silicon.

       **sw_si**: Stillinger-Weber potential, for silicon.

       **lenosky_Si**: Lenosky potential, for silicon.

       **eam_al**: Embedded atom method parameterized for aluminum.

       **qsc**: Quantum Sutton-Chen potential, for FCC metals.

       **zpice**: Water on platinum.

       **tip4p**: Point charge model for water.

       **bopfox**: Bond order potential, for metals.

**quiet**

   default: False

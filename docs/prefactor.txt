**min_displacement**: Minimum amount that an atom has to move to be included in
the Hessian calculation.

    default: ``0.25``

**within_radius**: Atoms within this radius of moving atoms are included in the
Hessian.

    default: ``5.0``

**default_value**: Calculate prefactor if zero, otherwise use given value
instead of doing a full prefactor calculation.

    default: ``0``

**min_value**: Minimum value for a reasonable prefactor.

    default: ``1e+9``


**max_value**: Maximum value for a reasonable prefactor.

    default: ``1e+21``

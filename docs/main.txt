These are the options that go in **[Main]** section of the config.ini file.

**job**: The type of job to execute.

    default: ``akmc``

    options:

        ``md``: Molecular dynamics.

        ``parallel_replica``: Calculate the rare-event dynamics of the system by combining transitions observed from multiple trajectories run in parallel.

        ``saddle_search``: Do a saddle point search using a minimum mode method.

        ``displacement_sampling``: Job to sample different displacement methods and parameters to see which are the most efficient.

        ``process_search``: Combined saddle search, minimizations, and prefactor calculations. Used by the aKMC method.

        ``basin_hopping``: Search for global minimum using basin hopping method.

        ``minimization``: Find the minimum from an initial configuration.

        ``akmc``: Run an adaptive kinetic monte carlo simulation.

        ``hessian``: Calculate the Hessian matrix for the specified configuration in a process.

**random_seed**: Takes an integer number for the random seed. If this number is less than zero the current time is used as the random seed.

    default: ``-1``

**temperature**: The temperature that the job will run at.

    default: ``300.0``

**finite_difference**: The finite difference distance to use for dimer, hessian, lanczos, and optimization methods.

    default: ``0.01``

**quiet**:

    default: ``False``
